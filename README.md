# Project Overview
This repository contains several sample FastAPI applications, each implementing different functionalities, showcasing API development with FastAPI, handling authentication, performing database operations, and working with asynchronous tasks. Below is a detailed explanation of what each file does.
## Files and Descriptions
### 1. `forlogin_plus_jwt_toke.py` 
üîç What This Project Demonstrates
This FastAPI project is designed not only as a working authentication service, but also as a demonstration of practical, real-world backend skills. Here's what it showcases:

‚úÖ Secure Authentication with JWT (Cookies-Based)
Implements JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication using the authx library.

Tokens are stored securely in HTTP-only cookies to prevent XSS attacks.

Follows best practices for token generation and validation.

‚úÖ Refresh Token Flow
Supports access and refresh token pair strategy.

Allows token renewal without requiring the user to log in again.

Demonstrates a good understanding of secure session management.

‚úÖ Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
Integrates user roles (e.g., admin, user) directly into the JWT payload.

Protects sensitive routes using Depends and role checking.

Shows how to build granular access policies in modern APIs.

‚úÖ Password Hashing with Bcrypt
Uses passlib to securely hash user passwords.

Ensures password safety by avoiding plain-text storage.

Demonstrates awareness of real-world security concerns.

‚úÖ Mock User Database (Simulation)
Simulates a user database with in-memory dictionaries.

Mimics real login and authentication flow for testing/demo purposes.

‚úÖ Modular and Clean Architecture
Clear separation of concerns between:

Authentication logic

User verification

Token management

Protected route handling

Ready for easy extension into full-scale services (e.g., with a real database or user registration).

‚úÖ Global Exception Handling
Implements centralized error handling for cleaner and consistent API responses.

Uses custom error messages for common authentication issues (e.g., invalid credentials, access denied).

‚úÖ Logging for Security & Debugging
Adds logging for login attempts, errors, and important events.

Helps in tracing events and securing your system in production.

‚úÖ Interactive Documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI)
Automatically generates interactive API documentation with FastAPI.

Makes testing and exploring the API very easy via /docs.
### 2. `sync_and_async_tasks_running.py` 
üöÄ Features
Uses FastAPI's BackgroundTasks to handle operations after sending a response

Simulates:

a blocking synchronous task using time.sleep

a non-blocking asynchronous task using asyncio.sleep

Returns a response immediately while tasks are handled in the background

Ideal for tasks like sending emails, writing logs, or calling external APIs

üìå How It Works
sync_task() simulates a blocking operation that takes 2 seconds.

async_task() simulates an async operation with a 3-second delay.

Both tasks are added to FastAPI‚Äôs BackgroundTasks queue, which executes them after the response is returned to the client.

This serves as an example of using FastAPI's `BackgroundTasks` feature to handle potentially time-consuming operations without blocking the main application flow.
### 3. `bdtest.py` 
üöÄ Features
Fully async FastAPI endpoints

SQLAlchemy 2.0 ORM with async support (AsyncSession)

SQLite database with aiosqlite driver

Pydantic models for request validation and response schemas

Dependency injection with Depends and Annotated

CORS middleware for frontend compatibility

Full CRUD functionality: create, read, update, delete

Auto-refresh of database objects after write

Modular and scalable code structure

üìÅ Endpoints
Method	Endpoint	Description
POST	/setup-database	Initializes the database
POST	/add-book	Adds a new book
GET	/get-books	Returns all books
GET	/get-book/{book_id}	Returns a specific book by ID
PUT	/update-book/{book_id}	Updates book details
DELETE	/delete-book/{book_id}	Deletes a book by ID

üß† What This Project Demonstrates
This project shows proficiency in:

Building fully asynchronous web APIs using FastAPI

Using SQLAlchemy 2.0 with its modern async ORM

Implementing Pydantic-based validation for robust APIs

Managing database sessions with proper async lifecycle

Writing clean and scalable code using best practices

Providing a clear and intuitive REST API design
### 4. `for_docker_main.py` 
This file provides a minimal FastAPI application intended for deployment in a containerized environment, such as Docker. It includes:
- A single endpoint (`/users`) that returns basic user information as an example.

The file focuses on simplicity and is ideal for demonstrating the deployment of FastAPI apps when integrated with container solutions like Docker.
### 5. `book.py` 
This file contains a basic in-memory implementation for managing a collection of books. It is a simple example contrasting against `bdtest.py` by not using a database. Key features:
- Stores a sample book collection directly in Python dictionaries.
- Provides endpoints to perform CRUD operations:
    - `/all_books`: Retrieve all books.
    - `/book/{book_id}`: Get a specific book by its ID.
    - `/create_book`: Add a new book to the collection.
    - `/update_book/{book_id}`: Update a book's details.
    - `/delete_book/{book_id}`: Remove a book from the collection.

This file serves as an example of a lightweight, database-free API implementation for managing books.
