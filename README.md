# Project Overview
This repository contains several sample FastAPI applications, each implementing different functionalities, showcasing API development with FastAPI, handling authentication, performing database operations, and working with asynchronous tasks. Below is a detailed explanation of what each file does.
## Files and Descriptions
### 1. `forlogin_plus_jwt_toke.py` 
This file demonstrates an API with username/password-based authentication and JSON Web Tokens (JWT). Key functionalities include:
- User login endpoint (`/login`), which verifies credentials and generates a secure JWT access token. The token is stored in an HTTP-only cookie.
- Protected endpoint (`/protected`), which is only accessible by authenticated users. The route uses JWT tokens for access and verifies the token's validity via middleware integrations.

This file is a foundational example of secure user authentication using FastAPI and JWT.
### 2. `sync_and_async_tasks_running.py` 
This file showcases how to handle both synchronous and asynchronous background tasks within a FastAPI application. Key features:
- Demonstrates a **synchronous task** (`sync_task`) that performs an operation with a delay.
- Contains an **asynchronous task** (`async_task`) to highlight how asynchronous operations can run alongside synchronous ones.
- An endpoint (`/`) that triggers both tasks in the background when accessed.

This serves as an example of using FastAPI's `BackgroundTasks` feature to handle potentially time-consuming operations without blocking the main application flow.
### 3. `bdtest.py` 
This file demonstrates how to interact with a database using SQLAlchemy and FastAPI. It implements CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing a collection of books. Highlights include:
- Sets up a SQLite database (`books.db`) using `sqlalchemy.ext.asyncio` to support asynchronous database operations.
- Provides the following endpoints for book management:
    - `/setup-database`: Initializes or resets the database.
    - `/add-book`: Adds a new book entry with a title and author.
    - `/get-books` & `/get-book/{book_id}`: Retrieve all books or a specific book by ID.
    - `/update-book/{book_id}`: Updates the title and author of a specific book entry.
    - `/delete-book/{book_id}`: Deletes a specific book entry from the database.

This file serves as a practical example of creating RESTful APIs for managing a database using FastAPI's dependency injection along with SQLAlchemy.
### 4. `for_docker_main.py` 
This file provides a minimal FastAPI application intended for deployment in a containerized environment, such as Docker. It includes:
- A single endpoint (`/users`) that returns basic user information as an example.

The file focuses on simplicity and is ideal for demonstrating the deployment of FastAPI apps when integrated with container solutions like Docker.
### 5. `book.py` 
This file contains a basic in-memory implementation for managing a collection of books. It is a simple example contrasting against `bdtest.py` by not using a database. Key features:
- Stores a sample book collection directly in Python dictionaries.
- Provides endpoints to perform CRUD operations:
    - `/all_books`: Retrieve all books.
    - `/book/{book_id}`: Get a specific book by its ID.
    - `/create_book`: Add a new book to the collection.
    - `/update_book/{book_id}`: Update a book's details.
    - `/delete_book/{book_id}`: Remove a book from the collection.

This file serves as an example of a lightweight, database-free API implementation for managing books.
